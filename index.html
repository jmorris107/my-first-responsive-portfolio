              <p>Something personal about me, I was born in San Francisco CA, however I spent most of my life in Japan.  I attended school in Japan until I completed a technical college, the equivalent of an associate’s degree in the United States.  For that reason I consider myself Japanese. </p>
                <p>I am a junior software developer in New York. I'm currently learning coding at Columbia Engineering Bootcamp.</p>
                <p>I graduated from Queens College in 2020, and my major was accounting. The reason I chose an engineering career is because I took a computer science class in Queens College which opened my eyes to coding and engineering. </p>
                <p>I think this is an intriguing and challenging career.</p>
                <p>Also, there are still a lot of oppotunities to experience as a software developer even during this pandemic. This really atracted me to pursue this career.</p>
                <p>My favorite quote comes from a Japanese proverb and it says “Nanakorobi-Yaoki” In English it translates to, “If you fall down seven times, get up eight”.  To me, the meaning of this proverb is to be resilient.  Never quit, never give up.  We all fail, but what is important is to have the courage to never stop trying and to never stop moving forward.</p>
